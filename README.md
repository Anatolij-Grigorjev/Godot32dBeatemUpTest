# Godot32dBeatemUpTest
Testing specific code architectures in Godot for compatibility with a 2D beat-em-up style game

For this, art assets of the freeware fighting game Little Fighter 2 (http://www.lf2.net) will be used (simply because they offer convenient complete sprtie sheets for experimentation)
All credit for associated resources goes to the wonderful Marti and Starksy Wong!
